# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

Welcome to my CIFAR-10 image classification project! This project explores the CIFAR-10 dataset using deep learning techniques for image classification.

## Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The goal of this project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately classify images into their respective categories.

## Contents

- `cifar10_image_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Usage

To run the code in Google Colab:

Open the notebook file in this repository.
Click on the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the notebook to open it in Google Colab.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and analyze the results.
That's it! If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out.

## About the Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton and contains labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset.

For more details about the dataset and its usage, refer to the following technical report:
